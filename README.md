# Now
Time management is hard.  In fact, that's an understatement, time management is impossible.  Most of us are at the mercy of our own whims, slaves to distractions and procastination without realizing.  
**Now** is a project that will help.  It's a time budgeting app, which attempts to account for **all** your time.  It doesn't try to make you more 'productive', it tries to help you understand where you *spend* your time.
  
## Philosophy
Now is a philisophical tool.  It makes some assumptions about the value of time, namely that time is literally money.  It recognizes that you can't 'make time' to do something, instead it helps you **balance** your time.  The value of a task is = to the value that would be lost if you didn't do that task.  This also applies to partially or completely finishing a task.
